To enable wide-scale community testing of the upcoming Spark 4.0 release, the Apache Spark community has posted a preview release of
Spark 4.0. This preview is not a stable release in terms of either API or functionality, but it is meant to give the community early
access to try the code that will become Spark 4.0. If you would like to test the release, please download it, and send feedback using
either the mailing lists or JIRA.

There are a lot of exciting new features added to Spark 4.0, including ANSI mode by default, Python data source, polymorphic
Python UDTF, string collation support, new VARIANT data type, streaming state store data source, structured logging, Java 17 by default,
and many more.

We'd like to thank our contributors and users for their contributions and early feedback to this release. This release would not have
been possible without you.

To download Spark 4.0.0-preview1, head over to the <a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-4.0.0-preview1">download page</a>.
It's also available in PyPI, with version name "4.0.0.dev1".
